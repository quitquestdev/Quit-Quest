# Step-by-Step: Creating a Pull Request on GitHub

## You're on the Right Track! Here's What to Do:

### Step 1: Go to the Pull Requests Page
1. Visit: `https://github.com/quitquestdev/Quit-Quest/pulls`
2. You should see a yellow banner that says something like:
   - "**claude/review-code-runability-011CUSDky7Kf3Ed8ofQC9v2H** had recent pushes"
   - With a green button: "**Compare & pull request**"

### Step 2: Click "Compare & pull request"
- If you see this yellow banner, click the green "**Compare & pull request**" button
- If you DON'T see the banner, click the green "**New pull request**" button instead

### Step 3: Set Up the Pull Request
You should now see a page titled "**Comparing changes**"

Make sure the dropdowns at the top show:
- **base:** `main` ‚Üê (this is where changes will go)
- **compare:** `claude/review-code-runability-011CUSDky7Kf3Ed8ofQC9v2H` ‚Üê (this has your fixes)

Below that, you'll see:
- ‚úÖ A green checkmark saying "**Able to merge**"
- A list of changed files (should show index.html, README.md, etc.)

### Step 4: Create the Pull Request
1. Add a title (or keep the default)
2. Click the green "**Create pull request**" button
3. This will create the PR and take you to a new page

### Step 5: NOW You'll See the Merge Button!
On the pull request page, scroll down and you should see:
- A green button that says "**Merge pull request**"
- Click it!
- Then click "**Confirm merge**"

### What if I Still Don't See It?

**Scenario A:** You might not have permissions
- Make sure you're logged in as the repository owner
- Check that you have write access to the repository

**Scenario B:** You might be on the wrong page
- The merge button only appears AFTER you create the pull request
- It won't be visible on the "New pull request" or "Comparing changes" pages

**Scenario C:** There might be conflicts
- If there are merge conflicts, you'll see a message about them
- Let me know and I can help resolve them

## Quick Alternative: Direct URL

Try this direct link to compare the branches:
```
https://github.com/quitquestdev/Quit-Quest/compare/main...claude/review-code-runability-011CUSDky7Kf3Ed8ofQC9v2H
```

This should take you straight to the comparison page where you can click "Create pull request"

## Still Stuck?

Let me know where you are in the process:
1. Are you on the "Pull requests" tab?
2. Do you see any yellow banners?
3. What buttons do you see?
4. Can you see the "Create pull request" button?

I'll help you get this merged! üöÄ
